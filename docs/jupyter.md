# Jupyter Notebook

In order to prepare your computer for use in MTH 309 you will need
to install Python and Jupyter Notebook software.

## Installation instructions

1. Install the [Anaconda Distribution of Python 3.8](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads).

**Note.** If you have Anaconda previously installed, make sure that it includes Python 3.6 or higher, and fairly
recent versions of the Jupyter Notebook and the following Python packages: sympy, numpy, matplotlib, bokeh, requests.
Upgrade if needed. If you are installing Anaconda for the first time, don't worry about it, everything is included
in the distribution.

2. A part of the Anaconda distribution is the Jupyter Notebook app. It can be launched by typing:

`jupyter notebook`

in a terminal (Mac and Linux) or command prompt (Windows). Once you execute this command, a web browser will open showing
the  Jupyter Notebook dashboard. Here is a short video which demonstrates basic functionality of the Jupyter Notebook.
Watching the first 4 minutes or so will be enough to get started.

## Working with Jupyter files

Every Jupyter notebook you create is stored on your computer as a file with the `.ipynb`
extension. You can check where these files are located by opening a new or existing notebook,
typing pwd in a code cell, and executing the cell. This will display
the path to the directory with the notebook.
